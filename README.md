**Throughout next 12 weeks of the Makers Academy bootcamp I intend to keep developing it using skills I pick up along the way (build a website with an easy to use interface, use a database etc.).**

TIMELINE:

Week 1-4 (Pre-Course)

I'm currently in my last week of the Pre-Course. Skills I have learned so far allow me to build this simple CRUD application. It will show my ability to write clear and concise methods and work with files. 

Functionalities added so far:
- Adding a new issue to the .csv file tracking issues.
- Printing all issues tracked.
- Printing only active issues (excluding fixed issues).
- Filtering by issue's status / priority.
- Updating status / priority of a specific issue.

Week 5-8 

TBC.
