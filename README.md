**Throughout next 12 weeks of the Makers Academy bootcamp I intend to keep developing it using skills I pick up along the way (build a website with an easy to use interface, use a database etc.).**


Week 1-4 (Pre-Course)

I'm currently in my last week of the Pre-Course. Skills I have learned so far allow me to build this simple CRUD application. It will show my ability to write clear and concise methods and work with files.


Week 5-8 

TBC.
